            <p>
             Judo (柔道, jūdō, Japanese pronunciation: [dʑɯꜜːdoː], lit. "gentle way") is generally categorized as a modern Japanese martial art,
             which has since evolved into an Olympic and Paralympic event. The sport was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano (嘉納治五郎) as a physical,
             mental, and moral pedagogy in Japan. With its origins coming from jujutsu, judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element,
             where the objective is to either throw or take down the opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue the opponent with a pin,
             or force the opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo,
             but only in pre-arranged forms (kata, 形) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori, 乱取り).
             It was also referred to as Kanō Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the Olympic event.
            </p>
            <p>
             A judo practitioner is called a "judoka", and the judo uniform is called "judogi".
             The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from koryū (古流, traditional schools).
             Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, Sambo and ARB. 
             Judo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.

            Judo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called 稽古着 (keikogi, keikogi) practice clothing or jūdōgi 
            (柔道着, judogi, judo clothing)[82] sometimes abbreviated in the west as "gi". 
            It comprises a heavy cotton kimono-like jacket called an uwagi (上衣, jacket), 
            similar to traditional hanten (半纏, workers' jackets) fastened by an obi (帯, obi, belt), coloured to indicate rank, 
            and cotton draw-string zubon (ズボン, trousers).Early examples of keikogi had short sleeves and trouser legs and the modern long-sleeved judogi was adopted in 1906.

            <p>
            A throw that places the opponent on their back with impetus and control scores an ippon (一本), winning the contest.
            A lesser throw, where the opponent is thrown onto his back, but with insufficient force to merit an ippon,
            scores a waza-ari (技あり).Two scores of waza-ari equal an ippon waza-ari awasete ippon (技あり合わせて一本,  ). 
            This rule was cancelled in 2017, but it was resumed in 2018. Formerly, a throw that places the opponent onto his side scores a yuko (有効).

            Two types of penalties may be awarded. A shido (指導 – literally "guidance") is awarded for minor rule infringements. 
            A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. 
            If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. 
            After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (反則負け – literally "foul-play defeat"), 
            but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make. 
            If hansoku-make is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in the expulsion from the tournament of the penalized player.
